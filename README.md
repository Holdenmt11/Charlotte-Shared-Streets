# Charlotte Shared Streets

Recently the City of Charlotte announced a shared streets program to designated certain streets for walking, wheelchair rolling, and biking. 

Eight locations around the city were initially chosen, and this map identifies areas where this could be expanded based off the city's critera. 

Inspired by [Sidewalk Widths NYC](https://github.com/meliharvey/sidewalkwidths-nyc), the map also identifies sidewalk widths around the city, which could further help prioritize locations.

 [Charlotte's sidewalk data](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/sidewalks) and [Mcklenberg County's Street Centerline](http://maps.co.mecklenburg.nc.us/openmapping/data.html?search=centerline) were used to create the map.

- Identified as an existing bike route/greenway connector OR provide a nearby route to an existing park or a greenway   
- Long enough to be useful for exercising and support responsible social distancing – at least ½ mile
